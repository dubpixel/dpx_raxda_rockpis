## PROJECT: dpx_raxda_rockpis

**Status:** v0.1.0 complete (2026-07-23) ✅  
**Branch:** `main`  
**Version File:** `CHANGELOG.md` (no separate VERSION file — no code)

### Architecture (2-minute summary)

3D print design project: custom two-part snap/bolt enclosure for the Radxa Rock Pi S SBC fitted with the Rockpi POE HAT v1.2. The case went through design iterations v8→v14 improving clearances for POE hat capacitors and lid retention. `src/reference/` holds official Radxa STEP/DWG geometry used as the design basis. The printable assembly is `STL/dpx_rocpis_Poe_case.3mf`. No code, no build system — CAD files and documentation only.

This enclosure is the recommended hardware platform for [dpx-buttnode](https://github.com/dubpixel/dpx_buttnode).

| Component | Tech/Location | Purpose | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|---------|-------|
| Printable assembly | 3MF / `STL/dpx_rocpis_Poe_case.3mf` | Final v14 case design | For PrusaSlicer / Bambu Studio |
| Reference geometry | STEP/DWG / `src/reference/` | Official Radxa Rock Pi S PCB/board models | **Source of truth for board dimensions** — do not edit |
| README | Markdown / `README.md` | Print settings, usage, design notes | dpx README template v0.6.0 |
| CHANGELOG | Markdown / `CHANGELOG.md` | Version history | Also serves as version source |

### Agent Rules (for this repo)

**Before ANY file change:**
1. Create feature branch from `main`: `feature/brief-description` or `docs/what-changed`
2. Version bump goes in `CHANGELOG.md` only (no VERSION file in this repo)

**While editing:**
- Never modify files in `src/reference/` — these are upstream official Radxa reference models
- Printable output files live in `STL/` — that's the release directory
- README follows dpx README template — fill in content, never replace the structure or remove template sections
- Changes here are almost always docs or new STL/3MF versions

**When done:**
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` with new version entry and date
- Create PR per AGENTS.md §1 template

### Critical Constraints

**MUST HAVE:**
- ✅ `src/reference/` kept intact — official Radxa STEP/DWG files, never edit or delete

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Modify files in `src/reference/` — upstream reference files, not our design
- ❌ Commit binary CAD source files (`.f3d`, `.FCStd`) — STL/3MF outputs only
- ❌ Replace the README structure — fill in content, don't replace the dpx template skeleton

### Key Decisions

- **3MF over STL:** `.3mf` embeds print settings (layer height, supports, orientation) alongside geometry — no separate slicer profile needed.
- **Reference models in-tree:** Official Radxa STEP files committed alongside the design so future redesigns always have board geometry at hand without hunting down upstream source.
- **No VERSION file:** Pure 3D design repo with no installable artifacts; version tracked in `CHANGELOG.md` only.

### Gotchas & Landmines

1. **`src/reference/` contains intentional duplicates.** `radxa-rock-pi-s-case-model_files/` is a copy of `Rock PI S 3D scan.stp` — intentional archiving, not an error.
2. **File names with spaces in `src/reference/`** — paths must be quoted in any shell commands touching these files.
3. **v14 is the final version.** The `.3mf` includes design iteration history v8→v14; only v14 is intended for printing.

### Common Operations

**Update the case design:** Replace/add files in `STL/`, bump version in `CHANGELOG.md`.

**Update README content:** Edit `README.md` — fill in About details, print settings, images. Never remove template sections (see user memory `readme-template.md`).

### Reference

See [README.md](../README.md) for print settings, hardware BOM, and design notes.

## 1. Automatic Workflow (MANDATORY)

These actions are **required** and must happen automatically. **NEVER ask permission** for these workflow steps.

### Branching Strategy

**BEFORE starting ANY code changes:**

1. Create a new branch from the default branch (master/main)
2. Never work directly on default branch
3. Branch naming conventions:

| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| New feature | `feature/brief-description` | `feature/mqtt-decoder` |
| Bug fix | `fix/issue-description` | `fix/telegraf-timeout` |
| Documentation | `docs/what-changed` | `docs/update-architecture` |
| Refactor | `refactor/component-name` | `refactor/docker-volumes` |

### Version Bumping

**BEFORE the first code change:**

Bump the version number according to semantic versioning:

| Change Type | Version Bump | Example |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| Bug fix, typo fix, documentation update | Patch (0.0.X) | 1.2.3 → 1.2.4 |
| New feature, new endpoint, new capability | Minor (0.X.0) | 1.2.3 → 1.3.0 |
| Breaking change, API removal, incompatible change | Major (X.0.0) | 1.2.3 → 2.0.0 |

#### Semantic Versioning Principles

**Format:** `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `2.4.7`)

- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes, breaking existing functionality
- **MINOR**: New functionality added in a backwards-compatible manner  
- **PATCH**: Backwards-compatible bug fixes, docs, typos

**Pre-1.0 versions (0.x.y):**
- Anything goes - breaking changes allowed in minor bumps
- Common for projects in initial development
- Move to 1.0.0 when API is stable and production-ready

**Pre-release versions:**
- Alpha: `1.0.0-alpha.1` (early testing, unstable)
- Beta: `1.0.0-beta.2` (feature-complete, testing for bugs)
- Release Candidate: `1.0.0-rc.1` (final testing before release)

#### Version Bumping Decision Tree

**When multiple changes occur, use the highest level:**
- Bug fix + new feature → Minor bump (not patch)
- New feature + breaking change → Major bump (not minor)

**Edge cases:**

| Scenario | Bump Type | Reasoning |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Internal refactor, no API change | Patch | No external impact |
| New optional parameter with default | Minor | Backwards-compatible addition |
| Changed parameter order | Major | Breaks existing calls |
| Deprecated feature (still works) | Minor | Deprecation warning added |
| Removed deprecated feature | Major | Functionality removed |
| Performance improvement | Patch | Implementation detail |
| New dependency added | Minor | Expands capabilities |
| Security fix | Patch | Even if behavior changes slightly |
| Database schema change | Major | Requires migration |
| Config file format change | Major | Breaking existing configs |

#### Version Bump Workflow

1. **Determine bump type** based on changes planned
2. **Update version number** in code/config files
3. **Create git commit**: `bump version to X.Y.Z`
4. **Tag the commit**: `git tag vX.Y.Z` (note the `v` prefix)
5. **Push with tags**: `git push && git push --tags`
6. **Update CHANGELOG** (if present) with version and changes
7. **Proceed with feature/fix implementation**

**Version commit should be standalone** - don't mix version bump with other changes.

#### Changelog Integration

If project has CHANGELOG.md, update it with version bump:

```markdown
## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- New feature description

### Fixed
- Bug fix description

### Changed
- Breaking change description
```
**If no CHANGELOG.MD file exists:** Create one in the root of the project.

**Where to bump version:**
- Python: `__version__` in `__init__.py` or `pyproject.toml`
- Node.js: `version` field in `package.json`
- General: `VERSION` file or constant in main entry point
- Docker: Version tag in `docker-compose.yml` or `Dockerfile` labels

**If no version file exists:** Create one in an appropriate location for the project.

### Version File Standards & Location

To ensure consistent version identification across projects, follow these standards:

#### Python Projects

**Preferred location: `app/__init__.py` or `src/__init__.py`**

```python
"""Project description."""

__version__ = "1.0.0"
__author__ = "dubpixel"
```

**Alternative: `pyproject.toml` (for modern Python packaging)**

```toml
[project]
name = "project-name"
version = "1.0.0"
```

**Alternative: `VERSION` file in project root**

```
1.0.0
```

Then read it in your module:
```python
from pathlib import Path
__version__ = (Path(__file__).parent / "VERSION").read_text().strip()
```

#### Node.js/JavaScript Projects

**Location: `package.json`** (standard)

```json
{
  "name": "project-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Project description"
}
```

#### Docker Projects

**Location: `docker-compose.yml` labels AND `Dockerfile`**

`docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
services:
  app:
    build: .
    labels:
      - "org.opencontainers.image.version=1.0.0"
      - "org.opencontainers.image.created=${BUILD_DATE}"
```

`Dockerfile`:
```dockerfile
LABEL org.opencontainers.image.version="1.0.0"
LABEL org.opencontainers.image.title="Project Name"
```

#### Bash Scripts/Utilities

**Location: Top of main script or separate `VERSION` file**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
VERSION="1.0.0"
SCRIPT_NAME="manage.sh"

# Or read from VERSION file:
# VERSION=$(cat VERSION)
```

#### Version Display (REQUIRED)

**Always provide a way to display the version:**

- Python CLI: `python -m myapp --version`
- Node.js: `npm run version` or built into CLI
- Docker: `docker inspect <image> | grep version`
- Bash: `./script.sh --version`

**Example implementations:**

```python
# In your main.py or CLI entry point
import argparse
from app import __version__

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('--version', action='version', version=f'%(prog)s {__version__}')
```

```bash
# In bash script
if [[ "$1" == "--version" ]] || [[ "$1" == "-v" ]]; then
    echo "$SCRIPT_NAME version $VERSION"
    exit 0
fi
```

#### Multi-Component Projects

For projects with multiple components (e.g., frontend + backend + Docker):

1. **Synchronized versioning**: All components share the same version
2. **Central `VERSION` file** in project root
3. **Scripts/tools read from central file**

Example structure:
```
project-root/
├── VERSION              # 1.0.0
├── backend/
│   └── __init__.py      # Reads ../VERSION
├── frontend/
│   └── package.json     # Reads ../VERSION via build script
└── docker-compose.yml   # Reads VERSION via envsubst or build args
```

### Pull Request Creation

**AFTER completing the task:**

Create a pull request with this format:

```markdown
## Changes
- [Brief list of what changed]
- [One item per significant change]

## Testing
- [How to verify the changes work]
- [Commands to run or steps to follow]

## User Prompt
[The original request from the user - verbatim]
```

**PR Title Format:** `[Component] Brief description`

Examples:
- `[MQTT] Add BLE decoder support`
- `[Docs] Consolidate architecture documentation`
- `[Telegraf] Fix enum processor deprecation`

**NEVER ask permission to create the PR - just do it.**

### Build Artifact Naming

Non-`main` builds append the branch slug to the filename so artifacts are
self-identifying without opening the run log.

| Branch | Filename |
|--------|----------|
| `main` | `<name>-vX.Y.Z.<ext>` |
| anything else | `<name>-vX.Y.Z-<branch-slug>.<ext>` |

```bash
if [ "$BRANCH" = "main" ]; then
  OUT="myapp-v${VERSION}.ext"
else
  BRANCH_SLUG=$(echo "$BRANCH" | sed 's|/|-|g' | sed 's|[^a-zA-Z0-9._-]|-|g')
  OUT="myapp-v${VERSION}-${BRANCH_SLUG}.ext"
fi
```

## 2. Progress Tracking for Multi-Step Work

When working on tasks that span **more than 3 files** OR **more than 30 minutes of work**:

### Checkpoint Progress

Provide a status update using this template:

```markdown
## Progress Checkpoint

✅ **Completed:**
- Item 1 description
- Item 2 description

⬜ **Remaining:**
- Item 3 description
- Item 4 description

→ **Next Action:** [Specific next step you will take]
```

### When to Checkpoint

- After completing a logical phase of work
- Before switching to a different component
- When encountering a blocker or decision point
- Every 3-5 file edits in large refactors

### Resuming from Checkpoint

When continuing work after a checkpoint:
1. Read the last checkpoint status
2. Start with the "Next Action" item
3. Update checkpoint when that phase completes

**Purpose:** Prevents agents from getting lost in complex multi-step tasks and provides visibility to the user.

---

## 3. File Header Standards

All code files must include a comprehensive header comment section:

```
# ================================================================================
# [FILE TYPE] - [FILE PURPOSE]
# ================================================================================
# you can maybe write some stuff here - tagline etc.
# ================================================================================
# PROJECT: [project_name]
# ================================================================================
#
# File: [filename]
# Purpose: [what this file does]
# Dependencies: [key dependencies if any]
#
# CHANGE LOG: (if needed but should really be in the changelog for the git)
# 
# 2026-03-06: Complete rewrite - Interactive wizard (v2.1.0)
#
# ================================================================================
```

### Header Guidelines

- Use consistent separator lines (80 characters of `=`)
- Adjust comment syntax for the language (`#` for Python/bash, `//` for JS/C++, etc.)


---

## 4. Documentation Standards

### Project Context Documentation

Project-specific architecture, decisions, and operational knowledge should live in the **PROJECT section at the top of this file**. This keeps rules and context unified in one scannable document.

**When to use a separate CONTEXT.md:**
Only create a separate `CONTEXT.md` if reference data becomes large enough to be noisy:
- Long IP/VLAN tables
- Full API response examples  
- Hardware pinout references
- Extensive data schemas

If you create CONTEXT.md for overflow, add a reference in the PROJECT section at the top: "See CONTEXT.md for full network topology."

### How to Document Project Context

**DO:**
- ✅ Keep it clean, factual, and scannable
- ✅ Update when architecture changes
- ✅ Add information when you learn important project details
- ✅ Use tables, code blocks, and clear headings
- ✅ Think: "What does the next agent need to know?"
- ✅ Write in present tense, authoritative voice

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Append conversation transcripts
- ❌ Include timestamps like "On Feb 12 we discussed..."
- ❌ Make it a session log or diary
- ❌ Duplicate content from README.md (link instead)
- ❌ Let it become verbose or messy

**Update frequency:** Whenever you make architectural changes or learn critical project information.

## 5. Core Principles


### No Modifications to Working Code

- Do not refactor, optimize, or "improve" code that is working unless explicitly requested
- Avoid drive-by refactors when implementing a feature
- If you see potential improvements, mention them but don't implement without approval

### Comprehensive Commenting

- Document all code with clear, meaningful comments
- Preserve existing comments unless they become obsolete
- Remove or update comments that are no longer accurate
- Document WHY, not just WHAT (the code shows what, comments explain why)

### Small, Incremental Changes

- Make one logical change per commit
- Break large tasks into smaller steps
- Test each change before moving to the next
- Make it easy to review and roll back if needed

### Stay Focused

- Complete the current task before suggesting next steps
- Answer only what is asked
- Don't anticipate or propose additional work unless requested

### Document Everything

- README.md must be updated and maintaned when appropriate as per these guidelines
- CONTEXT.md must be updated and maintaned when appropriate as per these guidelines
- a comprehensive CHANGELOG.md must be kept updated and maintaned when appropriate as per these guidelines
- you can maintain a small changelog in the header if you wish but main changelog should be in the MD

---

## 6. Documentation Standards

### Inline Documentation

- Maintain comprehensive inline documentation
- Update comments when code changes (keep them in sync)
- Document all function parameters and return values
- Include usage examples for complex functions
- Explain algorithms and business logic


### README Files

- Keep README.md current and accurate
- README is user-facing - focus on how to USE the project
- **Confirm all changes to README with the user before committing**
- README should not duplicate CONTEXT.md (different audiences)

### CHANGELOG.MD

- Keep CHANGELOG.md current and accurate
- CHANGELOG is user-facing - focus on changes, version numbers, dates and git hashes if needed
- **keep this automated in background**
- changelog could be retroactively updated to reflect git commit names if that adds clariy
- **any changes to existing changelog line items should be confirmed with user**

### Markdown Style

- Use consistent heading hierarchy (don't skip levels)
- Use tables for structured information
- Include code blocks with language tags
- Use relative links to other project files
- Keep line length reasonable (~80-100 chars for prose)

---

## 7. Code Quality Guidelines

### General Principles

- Write clear, readable code with meaningful names
- Follow established coding patterns within the project
- Implement proper error handling (don't use bare `except:` or `catch`)
- Write testable code with clear interfaces
- Maintain consistent formatting and style

### Language-Specific

Agents should infer and follow the conventions of the language they're working in:
- Python: Follow PEP 8
- JavaScript: Follow project's ESLint config if present
- Bash: Follow Google Shell Style Guide principles
- Other languages: Use community-standard style guides

### Testing

- Add tests alongside new logic when appropriate
- Use deterministic inputs for tests (inject time/randomness, don't read system state)
- Name tests by behavior (e.g., `test_early_finish_extends_break`)
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- if the process includes: using ssh into a remote server, or user input in any way. open a terminal first for the user so you both can read it. 

---

## 8. Change Management

### Commit Practices

- **Commit message format:** Short, plain English, lowercase verb
  - Examples: `add mqtt decoder`, `fix telegraf config`, `update documentation`
- Make one logical change per commit
- Commit functional units (don't commit broken code)

### Before Committing

- Verify the code works (run/test it)
- Update all relevant documentation
- Update file change logs
- Remove debug code and console.log/print statements
- Check that no credentials or secrets are included

### After Committing

- Push to the feature branch
- Create PR (as described in Section 1)
- Include verification steps in PR description

---

## 9. Collaboration Standards

### Respect Existing Architecture

- Understand existing architectural decisions before changing them
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous
- Suggest alternatives when appropriate, but don't insist
- Consider the impact of changes on the broader codebase

### Maintain Backwards Compatibility

- Don't break existing APIs unless explicitly requested
- Provide migration paths for breaking changes
- Document any compatibility changes in PR description

### Communication

- Explain the reasoning behind suggested changes
- Provide rollback information when making significant changes
- Be transparent about limitations or uncertainties
- Keep responses concise and focused

---

## 10. Configuration & Secrets

### Environment Variables

- Use `.env` files for local development
- Provide `.env.example` with all required variables (use placeholder values)
- **NEVER commit** `.env` files or actual credentials to git
- Document all environment variables in CONTEXT.md or README.md

### Sensitive Data

- Keep credentials in environment variables, not hardcoded
- Use service account files in standard locations (e.g., `~/.config/gcloud/`)
- Add sensitive files to `.gitignore` immediately
- If secrets are accidentally committed, notify the user immediately
